<h1>THE<br />
<big>MATHEMATICIANS</big></h1>

<h2>BY ARTHUR FELDMAN</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big>We gave this story to a very competent, and very pretty gal
artist. We said, "Read this carefully, dream on it, and come
up with an illustration." A week later, she returned with
the finished drawing. "The hero," she said. We did a double
take. "Hey! That's not the hero." She looked us straight in
the eye. "Can you prove it?" She had us. We couldn't, and
she left hurriedly to go home and cook dinner for her family.
And what were they having? Frog legs&mdash;what else?</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> were in the garden. "Now,
Zoe," said Zenia Hawkins to
her nine-year-old daughter, "quit
fluttering around, and papa will
tell you a story."</p>

<p>Zoe settled down in the hammock.
"A true story, papa?"</p>

<p>"It all happened exactly like
I'm going to tell you," said Drake
Hawkins, pinching Zoe's rosy
cheek. "Now: two thousand and
eleven years ago in 1985, figuring
by the earthly calendar of that
time, a tribe of beings from the
Dog-star Sirius invaded the
earth."</p>

<p>"And what did these beings
look like, father?"</p>

<p>"Like humans in many, many
respects. They each had two arms,
two legs and all the other organs
that humans are endowed with."</p>

<p>"Wasn't there any difference
at all between the Star-beings and
the humans, papa?"</p>

<p>"There was. The newcomers,
each and all, had a pair of wings
covered with green feathers growing
from their shoulders, and long,
purple tails."</p>

<p>"How many of these beings
were there, father?"</p>

<p>"Exactly three million and
forty-one male adults and three
female adults. These creatures
first appeared on Earth on the
island of Sardinia. In five weeks'
time they were the masters of the
entire globe."</p>

<p>"Didn't the Earth-lings fight
back, papa?"</p>

<p>"The humans warred against
the invaders, using bullets, ordinary
bombs, super-atom bombs
and gases."</p>

<div class="figright"><small><b>Illustrator: A. Lake</b></small><img src="images/001.png" width="397" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"What were those things like,
father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they've passed out of
existence long ago. 'Ammunition'
they were called. The humans
fought each other with such
things."</p>

<p>"And not with ideas, like we
do now, father?"</p>

<p>"No, with guns, just like I told
you. But the invaders were immune
to the ammunition."</p>

<p>"What does 'immune' mean?"</p>

<p>"Proof against harm. Then the
humans tried germs and bacteria
against the star-beings."</p>

<p>"What were those things?"</p>

<p>"Tiny, tiny bugs that the
humans tried to inject into the
bodies of the invaders to make
them sicken and die. But the
bugs had no effect at all on the
star-beings."</p>

<p>"Go on, papa. These beings
over-ran all Earth. Go on from
there."</p>

<p>"You must know, these newcomers
were vastly more intelligent
than the Earth-lings. In
fact, the invaders were the greatest
mathematicians in the System."</p>

<p>"What's the System? And what
does mathematician mean?"</p>

<p>"The Milky Way. A mathematician
is one who is good
at figuring, weighing, measuring,
clever with numbers."</p>

<p>"Then, father, the invaders
killed off all the Earth-lings?"</p>

<p>"Not all. They killed many,
but many others were enslaved.
Just as the humans had used
horses and cattle, the newcomers
so used the humans. They made
workers out of some, others they
slaughtered for food."</p>

<p>"Papa, what sort of language
did these Star-beings talk?"</p>

<p>"A very simple language, but
the humans were never able to
master it. So, the invaders, being
so much smarter, mastered all the
languages of the globe."</p>

<p>"What did the Earth-lings call
the invaders, father?"</p>

<p>"'An-vils'. Half angels, half
devils."</p>

<p>"Then, papa, everything was
peaceful on Earth after the An-vils
enslaved the humans?"</p>

<hr />

<p>"For a little while. Then, some
of the most daring of the humans,
led by a man named Knowall,
escaped into the interior of Greenland.
This Knowall was a psychiatrist,
the foremost on Earth."</p>

<p>"What's a psychiatrist?"</p>

<p>"A dealer in ideas."</p>

<p>"Then, he was very rich?"</p>

<p>"He'd been the richest human
on Earth. After some profound
thought, Knowall figured a way
to rid the earth of the An-vils."</p>

<p>"How, papa?"</p>

<p>"He perfected a method, called
the Knowall-Hughes, Ilinski technique,
of imbuing these An-vils
with human emotions."</p>

<p>"What does 'imbuing' mean?"</p>

<p>"He filled them full of and
made them aware of."</p>

<p>Zenia interrupted, "Aren't you
talking a bit above the child's
understanding, Drake?"</p>

<p>"No, mama," said Zoe. "I
understand what papa explained.
Now, don't interrupt."</p>

<p>"So, Knowall," continued
Drake, "filled the An-vils with
human feelings such as Love,
Hate, Ambition, Jealousy, Malice,
Envy, Despair, Hope, Fear,
Shame and so on. Very soon the
An-vils were acting like humans,
and in ten days, terrible civil wars
wiped out the An-vils' population
by two-thirds."</p>

<p>"Then, papa, the An-vils finally
killed off each other?"</p>

<p>"Almost, until among them a
being named Zalibar, full of saintliness
and persuasion, preached
the brotherhood of all An-vils.
The invaders, quickly converted,
quit their quarrels, and the Earth-lings
were even more enslaved."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, weren't Knowall
and his followers in Greenland
awfully sad the way things had
turned out?"</p>

<p>"For a while. Then Knowall
came up with the final pay-off."</p>

<p>"Is that slang, papa? Pay-off?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The coup-de-grace. The
ace in the hole that he'd saved, if
all else failed."</p>

<p>"I understand, papa. The idea
that would out-trump anything the
other side had to offer. What was
it, father? What did they have?"</p>

<p>"Knowall imbued the An-vils
with nostalgia."</p>

<p>"What is nostalgia?"</p>

<p>"Home sickness."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, wasn't Knowall
smart? That meant, the An-vils
were all filled with the desire to
fly back to the star from where
they had started."</p>

<p>"Exactly. So, one day, all the
An-vils, an immense army, flapping
their great green wings,
assembled in the Black Hills of
North America, and, at a given
signal, they all rose up from Earth
and all the humans chanted,
'Glory, glory, the day of our
deliverance!'"</p>

<p>"So then, father, all the An-vils
flew away from Earth?"</p>

<p>"Not all. There were two child
An-vils, one male and one female,
aged two years, who had been
born on Earth, and they started
off with all the other An-vils and
flew up into the sky. But when
they reached the upper limits of
the strato-sphere, they hesitated,
turned tail and fluttered back to
Earth where they had been born.
Their names were Zizzo and
Zizza."</p>

<p>"And what happened to Zizzo
and Zizza, papa?"</p>

<p>"Well, like all the An-vils, they
were great mathematicians. So,
they multiplied."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," laughed Zoe, flapping
her wings excitedly, "that
was a very nice story!"</p>
